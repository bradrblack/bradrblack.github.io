<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The first <a href="https://github.com/bradrblack/pixel-gadget"> Pixel Gadget</a> was created in December 2021 and is a stand-alone, non-network-connected gadget that cycles through mesmerizing patterns on a bright 8x8 NeoPixel matrix.  </p><h3>Pixel Gadget Cloud is a software updated version that provides a few cool new features...</h3>
<ol>
<li>A clock feature provides accurate time in either a standalone "clock" mode or by showing the time on the hour and half-hour during normal color cycling pattern mode.  Network Time Protocol is used to keep the clock in sync.  In clock mode, the hour digit is shown and the minutes are represented by two cycling pixels that represent the approxmiate minute of the hour.  If you're using voice integration, you can ask Pixel Gadget to display the time and it will show the full time using a scrolling animation!
<li>An optional ability to connect to a cloud service that can integrate with IFFT (If this then that) enabling voice control with Google Assitant and Amazon Alexa.  Voice control features include:
<ul>
<li>Show current time: Hey Google, "gadget time" 
<li>Change to clock mode: Hey Google, "gadget clock" 
<li>Change to next color/pattern: Hey Google, "gadget change"
<li>Change to a specific color: Hey Google, "gadget red|blue|purple|green|random|christmas"
<li>Change the intensity: Hey Google, "gadget high|low"
<li>Save the current color/intensity for startup: Hey Google, "gadget save"
<li>Restart: Hey Google, "gadget reset|restart|reboot"
</ul>
<li>A setup utility on first start and reset to allow configuration such as the WiFi network, Cloud integration account info and setting the time zone.  You can now long press on the button for over 10 seconds to reset all of this config info.  Hold down the button until you see the screen clear and light up again.
</ol>
